   - **EMC Testing and Compliance**:
     - Document the steps taken to ensure compliance with **EN 55032:2015 + A11:2020 + A1:2020** (emission requirements) and **EN 55035:2017 + A11:2020** (immunity requirements).
     - Include a summary of EMC testing results and any design considerations made to minimize electromagnetic interference.
   - **Technical Documentation**:
     - Ensure the documentation includes information about how the microscope avoids creating electromagnetic disturbances and how it is protected against external disturbances, particularly when operating in environments with significant electronic noise (e.g., on a boat).

### 3. **Directive 2014/35/EU (Low Voltage Directive - LVD)**
   - **Electrical Safety Compliance**:
     - Include a detailed section on compliance with **EN IEC 62368-1:2020 + A11:2020**. This should cover the design considerations for safe operation at low voltage, particularly with respect to the 12V power supply and any internal power conversions.
     - Ensure that the documentation specifies safe handling instructions, including protection against electrical shock and proper use of the IP66-rated case.

### 4. **Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS Directive)**
   - **Restriction of Hazardous Substances**:
     - The documentation should include a statement of compliance with the RoHS directive, referencing **EN IEC 63000:2018**.
     - Provide a list of materials and components used in the microscope, confirming that none of the restricted hazardous substances exceed the permissible levels.
     - Include instructions for proper disposal and recycling of the microscope in accordance with RoHS guidelines.

### 5. **EN ISO 12100:2010 (Safety of Machinery – Risk Assessment and Risk Reduction)**
   - **Risk Mitigation Strategy**:
     - Include a section that outlines how risks identified in the initial design phase were mitigated. This could involve mechanical design choices, software safeguards, and operational protocols.
     - Detail any residual risks and the precautions users must take to avoid them.

### 6. **EN 894 Series (Ergonomics Requirements for Design of Displays and Control Actuators)**
   - **Ergonomic Design**:
     - Ensure the documentation covers how the microscope’s interface (e.g., the 7-inch touchscreen and control buttons) meets ergonomic standards as per **EN 894-1:1997 + A1:2008**, **EN 894-2:1997 + A1:2008**, **EN 894-3:2000 + A1:2008**, and **EN 894-4:2010**.
     - Include ergonomic assessments in the user manual, providing guidance on the optimal setup for prolonged use and minimizing operator fatigue.

### 7. **EN ISO 13732-1:2008 (Ergonomics of the Thermal Environment)**
   - **Thermal Safety**:
     - If the microscope or its components (like the LED light or peristaltic pump) have surfaces that could become hot during operation, the documentation should include a thermal assessment.
     - Provide guidance on safe handling and use of these components to avoid burns, in line with **EN ISO 13732-1:2008**.

### 8. **EN ISO 13854:2019 and EN ISO 13857:2019 (Safety Distances and Minimum Gaps)**
   - **Physical Safety**:
     - Include specifications on the minimum gaps in the microscope’s design to avoid pinch points or crushing hazards, particularly in the motorized focus mechanism.
     - Document the safety distances maintained to prevent access to hazardous zones, ensuring compliance with **EN ISO 13854:2019** and **EN ISO 13857:2019**.

### 9. **EN ISO 20607:2019 (Instruction Handbook Drafting Principles)**
   - **Instruction Manual**:
     - The documentation should adhere to the general drafting principles set out in **EN ISO 20607:2019**. This includes clear, concise language, logical structure, and easy-to-follow instructions, with safety warnings and precautions highlighted where necessary.
     - Ensure that all technical terms are clearly defined and that instructions are supported by diagrams, images, and step-by-step guides.

### 10. **Maintenance and Safety (Regular Updates and Safety Checks)**
   - **Ongoing Compliance**:
     - Include a section on regular maintenance, ensuring that the microscope continues to meet the required standards over time. This should include routine safety checks and software updates, particularly for maintaining EMC compliance and safe operation.

By addressing these elements, the documentation will not only comply with the relevant EU directives and standards but also enhance the safety, usability, and reliability of the **openUC2 SOOP Microscope** in its intended operational environments.
