## Project Title: openUC2 SOOP Microscope

### 1. Introduction

#### Overview
At openUC2, our goal is to make microscopy accessible to a broad audience through an open-source approach. While we aim to serve a wide range of users, we also strive to maintain economic viability. To achieve this balance, we rely entirely on open-source systems. In collaboration with the Helmholtz Institute Hereon, we have developed a prototype that embodies the principles of flow-stop microscopy, creating a flow apparatus that can autonomously operate on a boat, allowing liquids to pass continuously through the focus of a microscope objective. Initially, the prototype was built using openUC2 cubes and tested in a small-scale experiment. It became apparent that for productive use, a more robust design was needed to withstand the challenging conditions on a boat, such as fluctuations and humidity. Leveraging insights from the modular design, we created a robust, modular 3D-printable setup featuring a professional USB 3 camera with an autofocus system. A small peristaltic pump ensures continuous flow through a flow cell's focus, and a strong LED illuminates the sample, achieving a resolution of approximately 3-5 Âµm.

#### Purpose
In marine biology, it is crucial to know what organisms are present in the ocean, where they are located, and when they appear. We were tasked by the Hereon Institute to monitor plankton in the upper layers of the ocean. Our system integrates with existing box systems from colleagues in Jena, which, although used for different applications, perform essential functions such as water filtration. Inspired by the planktoscope developed by French colleagues and the device distributed by Fairscope, our microscope aims to contribute to ocean research. It provides insights into how ocean temperature changes affect vegetation and food chains, and potentially how plankton influences the ocean's CO2 binding capacity, which is linked to water temperature. This emerging field of research urgently requires new data, and we aim to deliver a cost-effective yet robust solution to generate this data.

### 3. Getting Started

This is a high-level set of instructions assuming you have a ready-to-work device right in front of you.

![](./IMAGES/IMAGES_Assembly/IMG_20240724_123723.jpg)

#### Prerequisites
- **Required Hardware**:
  - A 12V power supply
  - silicone tubing with an outer diameter of 5 mm and an inner diameter of 3.5 mm
- **Required Software**:
  - Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based)
  - Docker
  - ADditional information here: [Docker Container for ImSwitch](https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitchDockerInstall) and [Setup Raspi For Docker + ImSwitch](https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitchDockerInstall/blob/master/launch_imswitch_raspi.md)

When you have the black box labeled openUC2 (Pellican-like) in front of you, open the locking levers at the front, near the handle, to flip open the lid, which is hinged. Inside the lid, you'll find a 7-inch Raspberry Pi display used for controlling the device with ImSwitch software, which enables continuous flow-stop microscopy with a camera. The device runs a standard Raspberry Pi image based on Debian. On the back, you'll find various ports for network, USB, and power connections.

To power the device:
1. Plug the 12V power supply into an outlet.
2. Connect it to the 12V power jack on the back of the device.

When powered on, both the Raspberry Pi and the stepper motor and lighting electronics will be activated. Inside the housing, a DC-DC converter adjusts the 12V to 5V to power the Raspberry Pi and Wi-Fi adapter. Once the Raspberry Pi boots, you'll see the desktop, and after a short while, a browser will launch, displaying the black ImSwitch interface. This interface shows a live stream and various buttons for hardware control. In the top tab, you can start and monitor the flow-stop process. On the back, you'll also find the inlets and outlets for the microfluidic system, currently using silicone tubing, which can be connected to existing systems like the Ferrybox. The microscope operates by using a peristaltic pump to alternate flow into the microscope's field of view, pausing to capture images, and repeating the process as needed.

#### Installation
To install the necessary software and drivers:

1. **Install Docker on the Raspberry Pi**:
   - Follow the [official Docker installation guide for Raspberry Pi](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/).

2. **Download the ImSwitch Docker image**:
   - Pull the ImSwitch Docker image from the repository: `docker pull openuc2/imswitch`.

3. **Set up the ImSwitch configuration**:
   - Download the ImSwitch configuration files from the openUC2 repository: `https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitchDockerInstall`.
   - Read through the docs to setup the service and let it startup automatically https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitchDockerInstall/blob/master/launch_imswitch_raspi.md
   - Check if the camera is mounted correctly by typing `sudo lsusb`, you should see something like HIK
   - Ensure the browser opens the ImSwitch interface on boot.

4. **Access the ImSwitch web interface**:
   - ImSwitch server can be accessed at: `https://localhost:8001/docs`.
   - The React app for streaming and hardware control is available at: `https://localhost:8001/imswitch/index.html`.

5. **Wi-Fi Setup**:
   - Configure the Raspberry Pi to connect to a Wi-Fi network with the following credentials:
     - **SSID**: Blynk
     - **Password**: 12345678
   - This can be done via a mobile hotspot or the included Wi-Fi adapter. Replace `localhost` with the device's IP address when accessing remotely, for example: `https://192.168.1.102/docs`.
